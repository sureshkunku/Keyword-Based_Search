# Keyword-Based_Search
Develop a keyword-based search feature that retrieves documents by performing a keyword search on the text content (all fields) within the documents.

**Business Use Case:**

Develop a keyword-based search feature that retrieves documents by performing a keyword search on the text content (all fields) within the documents.

**Implementation Guidelines:** 
Your task is to create a containerized system (which can consist of multiple applications/services) that can be deployed using the "docker-compose" command. The system and its applications should be designed to allow both horizontal and vertical scaling. You are free to use any publicly available software tools to build and implement this feature.

Please upload/commit all source code to a GitHub repository that our team can clone and review.

**Technical Details:**
The documents are in JSON format; attached along with this email.
The system should expose a single REST API endpoint, named "search," which accepts a "keyword" URL parameter. The response of this API call should consist of the most relevant documents based on the provided "keyword".
